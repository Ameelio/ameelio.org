# Introduction

Ameelio is a rapidly growing movement powered by the generous contributions of volunteers like yourself. You can join the fight against the monitization of prison communications and help us to transform the incarceration system in America. No big commitment is required, if all you do is review a single Pull Request, you are a maintainer and a hero.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Ameelio is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, responding to issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into Ameelio itself.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Ensure any code you contribute follows our style conventions as defined by the linter and includes relevant test coverage.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Ameelio? You can start by looking through issues tagged as beginner and help-wanted issues:
* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
* Both issue lists can be sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Getting Started with Open Source

Never contributed to open source before? Here are a few friendly tutorials to help you get started:

* [http://www.firsttimersonly.com/](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

# Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Ensure you have included tests that cover the changes you made. See the project README for how to run these.
    * Note the Ameelio Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors are also welcome. Some examples include:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
Any security issues should be submitted directly to team@ameelio.org
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at team@ameelio.org.

All other issues can be submitted on GitHub.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Ameelio, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Ameelio has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. Feedback is left as a review on the Pull Request itself.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
